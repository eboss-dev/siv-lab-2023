# SIV LABORATORY 2023

This is a repository for the laboratory part of signal image and video master course

## Lab 1 - 19/10/2023

In this laboratory we setted up a virtual envinronment in order to execute the code locally. Another way to execute code is using colab provided by google that has the most standard libraries already installed.
After we followed the various steps we received a refresher on some of the Python's APIs as well as some libraries commonly used such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.
At the end of the lesson we were given two exercises. The first one was started in class while the second one was given as an homework.

## Lab 2 - 31/10/2023

In this laboratory we discover the various functionalities of OpenCV and the main function used.

## Lab 3 - 15/10/2023

In this laboratory we used the convolve operation and the correlate function in order to smooth a signal using a kernel.
We defined a set of essential filters in order to perform different operations.
The exercises given at the end of the lesson were about the application of the filters saw together and the use of Tensorflow to predict handwritten digits.
